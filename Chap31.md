Assume for the purpose of contradiction that $n \mid ab$ and $\gcd(a, n) = 1$, but $n \nmid b$, so $gcd(n, b)=1$, for theorem 31.6, $gcd(n, ab)=1$ which is contradicting our assumption.

Suppose $x = kb + c$, we have

> For any integer $k > 0$, an integer $n$ is a **_$k$th power_** if there exists an integer $a$ such that $a^k = n$. Furthermore, $n > 1$ is a **_nontrivial power_** if it is a $k$th power for some integer $k > 1$. Show how to determine whether a given $\beta$-bit integer $n$ is a nontrivial power in time polynomial in $\beta$.

Because $2^\beta > n$, we only need to test values of $k$ that satisfy $2 \le k < \beta$, therefore the testing procedure remains $O(\beta)$.

For any nontrivial power $k$, where $2 \le k < \beta$, do a binary search on $a$ that costs

$$O(\log \sqrt n) = O(\log \sqrt{2^\beta}) = O(\frac 1 2\log 2^\beta) = O(\beta).$$

Thus, the total time complexity is

$$O(\beta) \times O(\beta) = O(\beta^2).$$

_[The following proof is provided by my friend, Tony Xiao.]_

Let $d = \gcd(a, b, c)$, $a = dp$, $b = dq$ and $c = dr$.

**_Claim_** $\gcd(a, \gcd(b, c)) = d.$

Let $e = \gcd(b, c)$, thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
b = es, \\\\
c = et.
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $d \mid b$ and $d \mid c$, thus $d \mid e$.

Let $e = dm$, thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
b = (dm)s & = dq, \\\\
c = (dm)t & = dr.
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose $k = \gcd(p, m)$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
            & k \mid p, k \mid m, \\\\
\Rightarrow & dk \mid dp, dk \mid dm, \\\\
\Rightarrow & dk \mid dp, dk \mid (dm)s, dk \mid (dm)t, \\\\
\Rightarrow & dk \mid a, dk \mid b, dk \mid c.
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $d = \gcd(a, b, c)$, thus $k = 1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\gcd(a, \gcd(b, c))
    & = \gcd(a, e) \\\\
    & = \gcd(dp, dm) \\\\
    & = d \cdot \gcd(p, m) \\\\
    & = d \cdot k \\\\
    & = d.
\end{aligned}
$$

By the claim,

$$\gcd(a, \gcd(b, c)) = d = \gcd(\gcd(a, b), c).$$

- $\gcd(a, n) \mid \gcd(a + kn, n)$.

    Let $d = \gcd(a, n)$, then $d \mid a$ and $d \mid n$.

    Since

    $$(a + kn) \mod d = a \mod d + k \cdot (n \mod d) = 0$$

    and $d \mid n$, we have

    $$d \mid \gcd(a + kn, n)$$

    and

    $$\gcd(a, n) \mid \gcd(a + kn, n).$$

- $\gcd(a + kn, n) \mid \gcd(a, n)$.

    Suppose $d = \gcd(a + kn, n)$, we have $d \mid n$ and $d \mid (a + kn)$.

    Since

    $$(a + kn) \mod d = a \mod d + k \cdot (n \mod d) = a \mod d = 0,$$

    we have $d \mid a$.

    Since $d \mid a$ and $d \mid n$, we have

    $$d \mid \gcd(a, n)$$

    and

    $$\gcd(a + kn, n) \mid \gcd(a, n).$$

    Since

    $$\gcd(a, n) \mid \gcd(a + kn, n)$$

    and

    $$\gcd(a + kn, n) \mid \gcd(a, n),$$

    we have

    $$\gcd(a, n) = \gcd(a + kn, n).$$

> Rewrite $\text{EUCLID}$ in an iterative form that uses only a constant amount of memory (that is, stores only a constant number of integer values).

> If $a > b \ge 0$, show that the call EUCLID$(a, b)$ makes at most $1 + \log_\phi b$ recursive calls. Improve this bound to $1 + \log_\phi(b / \gcd(a, b))$.

$$b \ge F_{k + 1} \approx \phi^{k + 1} / \sqrt{5}$$

$$k + 1 < \log_\phi \sqrt{5} + \log_\phi b \approx 1.67 + \log_\phi b$$

$$k < 0.67 + \log_\phi b < 1 + \log_\phi b.$$

Since $d \cdot a \mod d \cdot b = d \cdot (a \mod b)$, $\gcd(d \cdot a, d \cdot b)$ has the same number of recursive calls with $\gcd(a, b)$, therefore we could let $b' = b / \gcd(a, b)$, the inequality $k < 1 + \log_\phi(b') = 1 + \log_\phi(b / \gcd(a, b))$. will holds.

Suppose $n_1n_2 x + n_3n_4 y = 1$, then $n_1(n_2 x) + n_3(n_4 y) = 1$, thus $n_1$ and $n_3$ are relatively prime, $n_1$ and $n_4$, $n_2$ and $n_3$, $n_2$ and $n_4$ are the all relatively prime. And since $\gcd(n_1n_3, n_2n_4) = 1$, all the pairs are relatively prime.

General: in the first round, divide the elements into two sets with equal number of elements, calculate the products of the two set separately, if the two products are relatively prime, then the element in one set is pairwise relatively prime with the element in the other set. In the next iterations, for each set, we divide the elements into two subsets, suppose we have subsets $\\{ (s_1, s_2), (s_3, s_4), \ldots \\}$, then we calculate the products of $\\{ s_1, s_3, \ldots \\}$ and $\\{ s_2, s_4, \ldots \\}$, if the two products are relatively prime, then all the pairs of subset are pairwise relatively prime similar to the first round. In each iteration, the number of elements in a subset is half of the original set, thus there are $\lceil \lg k \rceil$ pairs of products.

To choose the subsets efficiently, in the $k$th iteration, we could divide the numbers based on the value of the index's $k$th bit.

> Prove Theorem 31.14.

A nonempty closed subset of a finite group is a subgroup.

- Closure: the subset is closed.
- Identity: suppose $a \in S'$, then $a^{(k)} \in S'$. Since the subset is finite, there must be a period such that $a^{(m)} = a^{(n)}$, hence $a^{(m)}a^{(-n)} = a^{(m - n)} = 1$, therefore the subset must contain the identity.
- Associativity: inherit from the origin group.
- Inverses: suppose $a^{(k)} = 1$, the inverse of element $a$ is $a^{(k - 1)}$ since $aa^{(k - 1)} = a^{(k)} = 1$.

To prove it is a permutation, we need to prove that

- for each element $x \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$, $f_a(x) \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$,
- the numbers generated by $f_a$ are distinct.

Since $a \in \mathbb Z_{n}^\*$ and $x \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$, then $f_a(x) = ax \mod n \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$ by the closure property.

Suppose there are two distinct numbers $x \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$ and $y \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$ that $f_a(x) = f_a(y)$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
              f_a(x) & = f_a(y) \\\\
           ax \mod n & = ay \mod n \\\\
(a \mod n)(x \mod n) & = (a \mod n)(y \mod n) \\\\
          (x \mod n) & = y \mod n \\\\
                   x & \equiv y \mod n,

which contradicts the assumption, therefore the numbers generated by $f_a$ are distinct.

Multiplicative: $e$ is relatively prime to $n$.

Decrypt: In each iteration randomly choose a prime number $m$ that $m$ is relatively prime to $n$, if we can decrypt $m \cdot M$, then we can return $m^{-1}M$ since $m^{-1} = m^{n - 2}$.

> Prove that $\lambda(n) \mid \phi(n)$. A composite number $n$ is a Carmichael number if $\lambda(n) \mid n - 1$. The smallest Carmichael number is $561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$; here, $\lambda(n) = \text{lcm}(2, 10, 16) = 80$, which divides $560$. Prove that Carmichael numbers must be both "square-free" (not divisible by the square of any prime) and the product of at least three primes. (For this reason, they are not very common.)

1. Prove that $\lambda(n) \mid \phi(n)$.

    We have

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
          n & = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_r^{e_r} \\\\
    \phi(n) & = \phi(p_1^{e_1}) \times \dots \times \phi(p_r^{e_r}).
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Thus,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \lambda(n) & \mid \phi(n) \\\\
    \Rightarrow \text{lcm}(\phi(p_1^{e_1}, \ldots, \phi(p_r^{e_r})) & \mid (\phi(p_1^{e_1}) \times \dots \times \phi(p_r^{e_r}))
    \end{aligned}
    $$

2. Prove that Carmichael numbers must be "square-free" (not divisible by the square of any prime).

    Assume $n = p^\alpha m$ is a Carmichael number, where $\alpha \ge 2$ and $p \nmid m$.

    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the system of congruences

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    x & \equiv 1 + p \pmod p^\alpha, \\\\
    x & \equiv 1 \pmod m
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    has a solution $a$. Note that $\gcd(a, n) = 1$.

    Since $n$ is a Carmichael number, we have $a^{n - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod n$. In particular, $a^{n - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod {p^\alpha}$; therefore, $a^n \equiv a \pmod {p^2}$.

    So, $(1 + p)^n \equiv 1 + p \pmod {p^2}$. Expand $(1 + p)^n$ modulo $p^2$ using the binomial theorem. We have

    $$(1 + p)^n \equiv 1 \pmod {p^2},$$

    since the first two terms of the expansion are $1$ and $np$, and the rest of the terms are divisible by $p^2$.

    Thus, $1 \equiv 1 + p \pmod {p^2}$. This is impossible.

3. Prove that Carmichael numbers must be the product of at least three primes.

    Assume that $n = pq$ is a Carmichael number, where $p$ and $q$ are distant primes and $p < q$.

    Then we have

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & q \equiv 1 \pmod{q - 1} \\\\
    \Rightarrow & n \equiv pq \equiv p \pmod{q - 1} \\\\
    \Rightarrow & n - 1 \equiv p - 1 \pmod{q - 1},
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Here, $0 < p âˆ’ 1 < q âˆ’ 1$ , so $n âˆ’ 1$ is not divisible by $q âˆ’ 1$.

## 31.8-3

> Prove that if $x$ is a nontrivial square root of $1$, modulo $n$, then $\gcd(x - 1, n)$ and $\gcd(x + 1, n)$ are both nontrivial divisors of $n$.

$$
\begin{array}{rlll}
           x^2 & \equiv & 1 & \pmod n, \\\\
       x^2 - 1 & \equiv & 0 & \pmod n, \\\\
(x + 1)(x - 1) & \equiv & 0 & \pmod n.
\end{array}
$$

$n \mid (x + 1)(x - 1)$, suppose $\gcd(x - 1, n) = 1$, then $n \mid (x + 1)$, then $x \equiv -1 \pmod n$ which is trivial, it contradicts the fact that $x$ is nontrivial, therefore $\gcd(x - 1, n) \ne 1$, $\gcd(x + 1, n) \ne 1$.

> **d.** Assume now that adding two $\beta$-bit numbers takes $\Theta(\beta)$ time and that multiplying two $\beta$-bit numbers takes $\Theta(\beta^2)$ time. What is the running time of these three methods under this more reasonable cost measure for the elementary arithmetic operations?

**a.** In order to solve $\text{FIB}(n)$, we need to compute $\text{FIB}(n - 1)$ and $\text{FIB}(n - 1)$. Therefore we have the recurrence

$$T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + \Theta(1).$$

We can get the upper bound of Fibonacci as $O(2^n)$, but this is not the tight upper bound.

The Fibonacci recurrence is defined as

$$F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2).$$

The characteristic equation for this function will be

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 & = x + 1 \\\\
x^2 - x - 1 & = 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can get the roots by quadratic formula: $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt 5}{2}$.

We know the solution of a linear recursive function is given as

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(n) & = \alpha_1^n + \alpha_2^n \\\\
     & = \bigg(\frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2}\bigg)^n + \bigg(\frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2}\bigg)^n,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are the roots of the characteristic equation.

Since both $T(n)$ and $F(n)$ are representing the same thing, they are asymptotically the same.

Hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
T(n) & = \bigg(\frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2}\bigg)^n + \bigg(\frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2}\bigg)^n \\\\
     & = \bigg(\frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2}\bigg)^n \\\\
     & \approx O(1.618)^n.
\end{aligned}
$$

**b.** This is same as [15.1-5](../../../Chap15/15.1/#151-5).

**c.** Assume that all integer multiplications and additions can be done in $O(1)$. First, we want to show that

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\\\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}^k
=
\begin{pmatrix}
F_{k - 1} & F_k \\\\
F_k & F_{k + 1}
\end{pmatrix}
.
$$

By induction,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\\\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}^{k + 1}
& =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\\\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\\\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}^k \\\\
& =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\\\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
F_{k - 1} & F_k \\\\
F_k & F_{k + 1}
\end{pmatrix}^k \\\\
& =
\begin{pmatrix}
F_k & F_{k + 1} \\\\
F_{k - 1} + F_k & F_k + F_{k + 1}
\end{pmatrix} \\\\
& =
\begin{pmatrix}
F_k & F_{k + 1} \\\\
F_{k + 1} & F_{k + 2}
\end{pmatrix}
.
\end{aligned}
$$

We show that we can compute the given matrix to the power $n - 1$ in time $O(\lg n)$, and the bottom right entry is $F_n$.

We should note that by 8 multiplications and 4 additions, we can multiply any two $2$ by $2$ matrices, that means matrix multiplications can be done in constant time. Thus we only need to bound the number of those in our algorithm.

It takes $O(\lg n)$ to run the algorithm $\text{MATRIX-POW}(A, n - 1)$ becasue we half the value of $n$ in each step, and within each step, we perform a constant amount of calculation.

The recurrence is

$$T(n) = T(n / 2) + \Theta(1).$$

```cpp
MATRIX-POW(A, n)
    if n % 2 == 1
        return A * MATRIX-POW(A^2, (n - 1) / 2)
    return MATRIX-POW(A^2, n / 2)
```

**d.** First, we should note that $\beta = O(\log n)$.

- For part (a),

    We naively add a $\beta$-bit number which is growing exponentially each time, so the recurrence becomes

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    T(n) & = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + \Theta(\beta) \\\\
         & = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + \Theta(\log n),
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    which has the same solution $T(n) = O\Big(\frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2}\Big)^n$ since $\Theta(\log n)$ can be absorbed by exponential time.

- For part (b),

    The recurrence of the memoized verstion becomes

    $$M(n) = M(n - 1) + \Theta(\beta).$$

    This has a solution of $\sum_{i = 2}^n \beta = \Theta(n\beta) = \Theta(2^\beta \cdot \beta)$ or $\Theta(n \log n)$.

- For part (c),

    We perform a constant number of both additions and multiplications. The recurrence becomes

    $$P(n) = P(n / 2) + \Theta(\beta^2),$$

    which has a solution of $\Theta(\log n \cdot \beta^2) = \Theta(\beta^3)$ or $\Theta(\log^3 n)$.
